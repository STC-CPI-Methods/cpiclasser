# Trained model:

This folder is reserved for trained model and supporting files. It will always be empty (on GitLab)
since GitLab isn't meant for large binary files and the potential of sharing confidential information.
The repo that is stored on CPD's _P_ drive at P:\Research\Code Library (CoLi) should contain the latest,
verified, model. In the future this model might also be distributed through other channels.
